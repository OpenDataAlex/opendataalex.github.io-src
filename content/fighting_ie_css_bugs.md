Well, it's been another busy week.  I just spent the last hour fighting with Internet Explorer.  Fortunately we're back 
on speaking terms - for now anyway.  I'm working on a customer site that uses css floats.  Well and good with Firefox - 
looks very clean and stylish.  I'll post a link when I'm finished with the site and have it up and running, but in the 
meantime check out the following link - also known as my Knight in CSS armor =p

[How to force IE to behave](http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html) 

It's a pretty nice site showing all the things that can go wrong when CSS and IE are in the same sandbox.  They seem to 
not like to share, and if you're not too careful they'll start trying to make each other eat dirt.....
