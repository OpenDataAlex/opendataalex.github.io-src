This blog will cover quite a few facets:

* BlueFire Data Solutions: Goings on with my company - updates with the website, software development, etc. etc.
* Thoughts, Tips, and Nudges: Ideas that have run through my mind as I work on developing databases and software.  
    Tips and suggestions from the trenches, so to speak.
* Tutorials and Guides: (Hopefully) helpful tutorials and guides about various software that I use/am learning.  
    Some of the more recent software packages that will probably have a tutorial before too long are Magento, Symfony, MySQL, and GIMP.
    
So if you have any suggestions, questions, coments, or concerns, please feel free to shoot me a line [here](alexmeadows@bluefiredatasolutions.com).
