Title: A Sad Day For Open Source

Today is a sad day for open source.  I found out only a couple of hours ago that Red Hat, like
many other open source companies before it, decided to sell itself to a group that will likely
do what Oracle did to Sun Microsystems.  It's a damn shame.  The only way this will work is if
IBM is smart enough to leave Red Hat as is and just utilize it for integration.

I imagine all my friends over there must be all kinds of livid/concerned.  Chin up and hope for
the best while preparing for the worst.
