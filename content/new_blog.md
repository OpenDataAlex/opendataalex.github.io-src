Title: Setting Up New Blog

I've been wanting to do this for a while now, and finally found the time/bit the bullet.  Wordpress, while awesome, 
just wasn't cutting it for me - especially since I had to pay quite a bit for hosting and the like.
For now, I'll use GitHub pages and go from there.  I have also switched over to using Pelican.
My plan is to get all the old content re-posted into the new blog, which I don't think will be too 
much trouble.  Just have to find the time.
