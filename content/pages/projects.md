title:  Open Source Projects

I've built a few open source projects/libraries because I've seen some needs.  Here's a list:

* [Process Tracker](https://github.com/OpenDataAlex/process_tracker) - Tired of reinventing the wheel when
  it comes to data integration flow management and dependencies?  Have more than one data integration tool
  that you have to manage?  Check out Process Tracker - the tool agnostic methodology for managing data integration
  flows!
  
* [etlTest](https://github.com/OpenDataAlex/etlTest) - A tool agnostic library for building unit tests for
  data integration flows.  In need of a some updating and polish.
  
* [Kettle Helper Scripts](https://github.com/OpenDataAlex/kettle-helper-scripts) - Work with Pentaho Data Integration?
  These scripts may help.
