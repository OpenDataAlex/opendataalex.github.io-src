Hi, I am Alex Meadows (aka OpenDataAlex)!  I'm a data engineer and full stack developer
with 15 years experience in various industries.  My passion is bringing data out in the
open, leveraging best practices in the Agile, Open Source, and data communities.

I love talking about data projects and helping make data more accessible.  I'm also available
for speaking engagements or having a fun problem solving conversation.  Have questions or
want to reach out?  Just check out my social accounts and we can touch base that way.
